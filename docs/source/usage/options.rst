Thresholding Options
====================


.. _accumulation plot:
.. figure:: ../images/options_accumulation.png
   :align: center

   Peaks above the :term:`detection threshold` are detected as particles. Merged peaks are split using their prominence.
   Peak regions above the :term:`accumulation threshold`, with at least the :term:`required points` detections, are summed.

To resolve particles from background signals a :term:`detection threshold` must be defined, above with signal is considered a particle.
SPCal offers three different thresholding methods, each with their own use-cases.
In general, Gaussian statistics should be used for thresholding signals with a high-mean background (> 10 counts) and Poisson statistics for those below.
For spICP-ToF data with low-mean backgrounds, Compound-Poisson statistics must be used.
For more a detailed discussion see :ref:`Thresholds for spICP-MS`.
Each method also allows the definition of an error-rate :math:`\alpha`, that corresponds to the expected number of falsely detected particles.

The method used for data can be selected using *Threshold method* in the **Options Tab**, with the following options.

#. Automatic
   Selects the most appropriate of Compound-Poisson, Gaussian and Poisson.

#. Highest
   Selects the highest threshold.

#. Compound-Poisson
   Uses Compound-Poisson statistics with the options in :ref:`Compound-Poisson options`.
   Recommended for ToF data.

#. Gaussian
   Uses Gaussian statistics with the options in :ref:`Gaussian options`.
   Recommended for data with a background signal > 10 counts.

#. Poisson
   Uses Poisson statistics with the options in :ref:`Poisson options`.
   Recommended for data with a background signal < 10 counts.

#. Manual Input
   Enables setting the *Detection threshold* manually in the **Sample Tab** and **Reference Tab**.

SPCal also allows editing of the *Accumulation method*, to set the :term:`accumulation threshold`.

#. Detection threshold
   Uses the :term:`detection threshold`, as calculated above, as the :term:`accumulation threshold`.
   This effectively disables the :term:`accumulation threshold`.

#. Signal Mean
   Uses the signal mean as the :term:`accumulation threshold`.

#. Half-detection threshold
   Uses the value half way between the signal mean and :term:`detection threshold`.

Settings the *Required points* to greater than 1 will require detected regions to contain at least this many points.

Both the :term:`accumulation threshold` and :term:`required points` controls are found in the thresholding *Advanced Options* dialog.

Compound-Poisson options
------------------------

.. list-table:: Compound-Poisson options in the **Options Tab**.
    :header-rows: 0

    * - :math:`\alpha`
      - The (Type I) :term:`error rate`.
    * - Method
      - The method used: lookup table, log-normal approximation or simulation.
    * - SIA :math:`\sigma`
      - The shape parameter used in the lookup table and log-normal approximation.
    * - SIA Dist
      - The distribution used in the simulation, must be loaded from a file.

Details on the method used to calculated the :term:`detection threshold` using Compound-Poisson statistics can be found in :ref:`Thresholds for spICP-MS`.
To load a SIA distribution press the left-most button. This will start a dialog to import data.
The loaded distribution can be viewed using the center button, or cleared using the right-most button.

Gaussian options
----------------

.. list-table:: Gaussian options in the **Options Tab**.
    :header-rows: 0

    * - :math:`\alpha`
      - The (Type I) :term:`error rate` used to calculate the z-value.
    * - :math:`\sigma`
      - The z-value.

The :term:`detection threshold` is calculated using Gaussian statistics as follows, :math:`\mu + z \sigma`.
The z-value is calculated from :math:`\alpha` using the quantile function of a standard normal distribution.
Editing :math:`\alpha` or :math:`\sigma` will adjust the other value to match.

Poisson options
---------------

.. list-table:: Poisson options in the **Options Tab**.
    :header-rows: 0

    * - :math:`\alpha`
      - The (Type I) :term:`error rate`.
    * - Advanced Options
      - Opens a dialog to select the formula used to calculate the threshold.

The :term:`detection threshold` is calculated using the :math:`\alpha` and the formula selected in *Advanced Options*.
The strengths and weaknesses of each formula are discussed in the MARLAP manual [1]_.


Windowed thresholding
---------------------

.. _threshold window:
.. figure:: ../images/tutorial_options_window.png
   :align: center

   Windowed thresholding can be used in samples with dynamic background, such as those collected by laser ablation.


A static threshold is easy to calculate and suitable most solution-based spICP-MS data.
However, in situations with dynamic backgrounds, such as when using laser ablation, a thresholding method that can adapt to the moving background is required.
SPCal implements *windowed thresholding* for these cases, and is enabled be checking the *Use window* option in the **Options Tab**.

Windowed thresholding is performed by calculating the local signal mean and :term:`detection threshold` in regions around each point. The size of the window is set using the *Window size* option.
Larger windows are less affected by local changes, but take longer to compute.

.. note::
    Windowed thresholding is only availble for Compound-Poisson thresholds when using the 'Lookup Table' method.

Iterative thresholding
----------------------

.. _threshold iter:
.. figure:: ../images/tutorial_options_iter.png
   :align: center

   Iterative thresholding can be used to more accurately approximate the mean in samples with many particles.

The presence of a large number of particles can impact the mean of the signal, and therefore the :term:`detection threshold`.
Iterative thresholding removes the influence of particles :term:`detection threshold` by sequentially filtering particle signal and re-calculating using non-detected regions.
Once the :term:`detection threshold` stops changing, the process is ended.
