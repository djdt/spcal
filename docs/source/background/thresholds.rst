Thresholds for spICP-MS
=======================

Poisson
-------

At the very low counting rates often seen in spICP-MS work, the typical Gaussian statistics (:math:`\mu + 3 \sigma`) used to determine detection limits do not apply.
Instead Poisson statistics should be used to determine the *critical value*, the threshold above which a signal is considered to be a detected particle [1]_ .
Confusingly, most Poisson statistics will also define a :term:`detection threshold`, but this should not be used to determine the detection of signal.
There are a number of different (more or less permissive) formulas for determining these thresholds, most of which are implemented in SPCal.

spICP-ToF: Compound-Poisson
---------------------------

    The data produced by a ToF MS is non-integer.
   
The Poisson thresholding typically used for spICP-MS is not valid for spICP-ToF, as is easily established by looking at spICP-ToF data.
Unlike data from a quadrupole instrument, this data is non-integer.
To achieve sufficient resolution a time-of-flight instrument cannot be operated in pulse-counting mode, where the electron pulses from individual ions are counted as discrete (integer) events [2]_ .
Instead, the detectors in TOFs use the raw output of fast analogue-to-digital converters and this exposes the variation in current produced by an electron multiplier for a single ion, known as the pulse-height distribution (PHD) or single-ion area (SIA) [3]_ .
The result of multiple ions striking the detector is therefore a Poisson sampling of the PHD, where each ion may produce a range of values.

.. _sia:
.. figure:: ../images/sia.png
    :width: 640px
    :align: center

    The single-ion areas of two ICP-ToF instruments, and log-normal fits.

To convert these values into counts the detector is calibrated to determine the SIA, typically by analysing a very low concentration sample, i.e. one that is likely to only produce single-ion events.
Multiple acquisitions of raw data from the detector are summed and then normalised to approximate the signal produced for 1 ion (count) by dividing by the mean of the recorded SIA.

Compound-Poisson sampling must be used to accurately determine a :term:`detection threshold` for spICP-ToF, ideally of the actual SIA of the instrument [3]_ .
In SPCal, this can be performed by brute force simulation or by using a log-normal approximation of the SIA.
For both methods, the lambda (mean) value of the Poisson is taken as the mean signal in the data set.
The simulation uses a given SIA distribution to generate a compound-Poisson distributed data and determines the threshold from the appropriate quantile of this data.
While accurate at high :term:`error rate` (:math:`>10^{-3}`) the computational cost to simulate enough samples for low :term:`error rate` is too high to be practical [4]_ .

Log-normal approximation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: ../images/sum_ln.png
   :width: 640px
   :align: center

   A spICP-ToF background and the corresponding log-normal approximation. Each log-normal (red) is summed to estimate the non-zero portion of the compound-Poisson distributed data.

The log-normal approximation works by closely approximating the SIA with a log-normal distribution, see :numref:`sia`.
Since the cumulative density and quantile functions of a log-normal are known, we can then predict the resulting :term:`detection threshold` for the sum of log-normal distributions.
In the case of the log-normal approximation only the shape parameter (:math:`\sigma`) of the log-normal fit to the SIA is required.

Lookup Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Similar to the :ref:`Log-normal approximation` the lookup table assumes the SIA can be approximated using a log-normal distribution. The lookup table is a 3-dimensional array of quantiles calculated for a zero-truncated compound-Poisson-log-normal distribution. Each quantile comes from a simulation of :math:`10^{10}` values using the parameters in the table below, using the computational facilities of the UTS eResearch High Performance Computer Cluster. Values between simulated points are interpolated at a sub 0.2 % error.




.. list-table:: Parameters in the lookup table.
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Range
     - No. Values
   * - :math:`\lambda`
     - 0.001 - 100 (geometric)
     - 71
   * - :math:`\sigma`
     - 0.25 -- 0.95 (linear)
     - 41
   * - :math:`\alpha` (zero-truncated)
     - 0.999 -- :math:`10^{-7}` (logistic)
     - 101


.. figure:: ../images/lookup_minimum_alpha.png

   :align: center

   The minimum valid alpha value (α) varies with the signal mean (λ). As λ decreases, the number of zero values increases and thus the zero-truncated α value used in the lookup table will represent a smaller (non-zero-truncated) Compound-Poisson α.

Threshold selection
-------------------

.. list-table:: Selection of statistics for determining the :term:`detection threshold`.
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Number of non-zero values below 5 counts
     - Number of non-zero values :math:`\mathbb{Z} \pm 0.05`
     - Threshold method
   * - :math:`>5%`
     - 
     - Gaussian
   * - :math:`<5%`
     - :math:`>75%` 
     - Poissson
   * - :math:`<5%`
     - :math:`<75%`
     - compound-Poisson

The best method to find the :term:`detection threshold` will depend on the data being analysed.
SPCal will use aspects of the loaded sample to choose between using Gaussian, Poisson of compound-Poisson statistics.
For data that is consistently above five counts, Gaussian statistics are used, otherwise Poisson or compound-Poisson depending on the integer nature of the data.
Values are considered integer if they are within 0.05 of an integer value, as data exports from ICP-MS often seem to have a small offset from true integers.
The detection threshold is then calculated for the chosen :term:`error rate` (:math:`\alpha`).

Error rates
-----------

In other analytical techniques a 5% :term:`error rate` (:math:`\alpha = 0.05`) is considered acceptable and is frequently used implemented as the :math:`3 \sigma` rule.
However, the large number of events collected during spICP-MS makes such low :term:`error rate` lead to a very large number of false detections.
An :term:`error rate` of :math:`\alpha = 10^{-6}` is fairly standard and will lead to only 1 false detection per million events.
